This is an example of creating a "Super Gallery". It is based on the 'Default' theme.

A "Super Gallery" is a gallery of galleries. You ask "Why would I want a "Super Gallery", 
Zenphoto does such a wonderful job of albums and subalbums, what could be the benefit
of a Super Gallery?"

With a Super Gallery, each gallery referenced from the index page is a fully functional 
Zenphoto gallery. This means it can have its own album folder (naturally) but it also
means it can have its own theme as well. So, you can have mixed themes in a Super Gallery.
Separate galleries also means the possibility of separate administration. Each gallery can
have its own admin user and password. This lets you assign a gallery to an individual to 
populate and maintain, but still keep the gallery "in the familly."

Creating a Super Gallery is almost as easy as creating a Zenphoto gallery. (Creating Zenphoto
galleries is a supset of creating a Super Gallery.) 

1. Create a folder for your primary gallery and upload install Zenphoto in it.
2. Within this folder, create folders for each of the sub-galleries you want and
install Zenphoto into them.
3. Select this theme for the primary gallery.
You are done.
