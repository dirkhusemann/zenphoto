Zenphoto 1.1.0 TODO

- Settable default values for newly instantiated PO's (esp. Title of images and albums)
- Merge with non sub-albums if we need to release quick.
- Merge subalbums to trunk! All the functionality is the same with current themes...
- Sub-albums: in order...
  1. Theme functions: make it work within a theme first.
  2. Admin functionality: allow full editing/sorting/renaming of sub-albums and their images.
- Admin Date interface; allow date entry for photos/albums
  - Get default date from EXIF data
- Photo rotation
- EXIF data in admin by default, and available within themes. Cache it in the DB? Yes!
- Compile a list of 'reported' bugs from the forums and try to fix them.
- Better comment control. 
  1. Ability to close comments by post or album.
  2. Simple spam filtering, allow blacklisted words, etc. Moderation queue!
- RSS Feeds (talk to people who have this done)
- Test in Safari/Mac
- Image hit counting?
- Improve the install script (create .htaccess, folders if needed, etc.)
- Internationalization!!! Provide translation ability for themes and admin 
  - Use GNU Gettext
