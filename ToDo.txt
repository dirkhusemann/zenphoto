
Zenphoto 1.1.0 TODO:
================================================================================
- Sub-albums: in order...
  1. Rewrite Rules for sub-albums etc.
  2. Admin functionality: allow full editing/sorting/renaming of sub-albums and their images.
  3. Admin improvements: paging, etc.
  4. Allow Moving/Copying/Renaming of files/folders with metadata preservation.
     (Maybe try "predictive" guesses of whether a newly discovered image/folder is renamed or actually new)
- Admin Date interface; allow date entry for photos/albums
  - Get default date from EXIF or file data
- Better comment control. 
  1. Ability to close comments by post or album.
  2. Simple spam filtering, allow blacklisted words, etc. Moderation queue!
- RSS Feeds (talk to people who have this done)
- Improve the install script (create .htaccess, folders if needed, etc.)
- EXIF data in admin by default, and available within themes. Cache it in the DB.
