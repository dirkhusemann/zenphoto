/**
 * dynamic-locale -- plugin to allow the site viewer to select a localization.
 * This applies only to the theme pages--not Admin. Admin continues to use the
 * language option for its language.
 * 
 * Only the zenphoto and theme gettext() string are localized by this facility. 
 * if you want to support image descriptions, etc. in multiple languages you will
 * have to add code to your theme to do so. We suggest you create a set of custom 
 * functions to handle database strings. You will also need a scheme for storing
 * multiple versions of your text.
 * 
 * In your custom function use a switch statement to see which language is selected
 * and output the appropriate translation.
 * switch (getOption('locale')) {
 *   case 'de_DE': <German string>; break;
 *   case 'fr_FR': <French string>; break;
 *   etc.
 * }
 *
 * Uses cookies to store the individual selection. Sets the 'locale' option
 * to the selected language (non-persistent.)
